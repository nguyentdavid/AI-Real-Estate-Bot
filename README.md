Instructions to run code:
Please be sure to have python installed on your device (I was on Python 3.10.7)
To install the requirements.txt for the libraries please make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the code
You can use the script below:
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the necessary requirements and you can run the code in any IDE that supports Python
You could also make this executable and run it in your terminal but I just used my IDE instead.
