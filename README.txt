Instructions to run code:
Download all of the .csv files, .py files, and the requirements.txt file
Please be sure to have python installed on your device (I was on Python 3.10.7)
I used a virtual environment and feel like this is the best decision for everyone as well.
In your respective terminal on your machines:
You can use this line to create/start a virtual environment
> python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows cmd.exe
   .venv\Scripts\activate		  # Powershell
Once you have created and are inside your virutal environment, you can install the requirements using:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
you should then be able to run the python file after the installations are complete.
> python RealEstateDL.py
this will execute in your environment and will also have 2 pop-up windows that show the plots of the results.

Thank you and please feel free to leave questions, comments, concerns, and I would love to receive as much 
constructive criticism so that I can make this much better in the future.
